# Data Schema

This document describes the current platform-feature markdown format. It remains valid for the existing site, but it should now be read as the legacy or transitional schema during migration toward the ontology-aligned model in [SCHEMA_PROPOSAL.md](/Users/snap/Git/ai-capability-reference/SCHEMA_PROPOSAL.md).

This document describes the format for platform feature files.

## File Structure

Each platform has its own markdown file in `data/platforms/`. The file contains:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML) - Platform metadata
2. **Pricing Table** - Plan tiers and prices
3. **Feature Sections** - One section per feature

## Format

```markdown

## Field Definitions

### Property Table Fields

| Field | Required | Format | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Category | Yes | See values below | Type of feature |
| Status | Yes | See values below | Release status (GA, Beta, etc.) |
| Gating | Yes | See values below | Access type (Free, Paid, etc.) |
| Launched | Yes | ISO 8601 | When the feature/change officially happened |
| Verified | Yes | ISO 8601 | When community confirmed info is accurate |
| Checked | Yes | ISO 8601 | When someone last looked at this entry |

### Date Fields Explained

These three dates separate **absolute truth** from **confidence**:

| Date | What it means | Who updates it | Example |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Launched** | When the vendor released/changed this | Update when feature changes | `2025-07-17T00:00Z` (Agent Mode GA) |
| **Verified** | When someone confirmed this is accurate | Update after verifying against official sources | `2026-01-20T12:00Z` |
| **Checked** | When someone last reviewed this entry | Update every time you look at it | `2026-01-20T14:30Z` |

**Example scenario:**
- You check ChatGPT Agent Mode on Jan 20
- You confirm the limits are still 40/mo for Plus
- Update `Checked` to now (you looked)
- Update `Verified` to now (you confirmed it's accurate)
- `Launched` stays the same (nothing changed on OpenAI's side)

**Another scenario:**
- You check on Jan 25, but OpenAI's help page is down
- Update `Checked` to now (you tried to look)
- Leave `Verified` unchanged (you couldn't confirm)
- `Launched` stays the same

|-------|--------|---------|
| Date | ISO 8601 | `2025-07-17T00:00Z` |
| Change | Brief description | `Feature launched (GA)` |

**Guidelines:**
- Use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ` (the `Z` indicates UTC)
- Most recent change first (reverse chronological)
- Only log actual feature changes, not verification updates
- Be specific about what changed (old value → new value)

```

## Contribution Rules

1. **Always include sources** - Every feature needs at least one official source link
2. **Update dates correctly**:
   - `Checked` → Every time you review an entry
   - `Verified` → Only when you confirm info is accurate against official sources
   - `Launched` → Only when the actual feature changes
3. **Update the Changelog** - When availability, limits, platforms, or status change
4. **Use talking points** - Write them as if you're presenting to a training audience
5. **Be specific about limits** - "40/month" is better than "limited"
6. **Note regional restrictions** - Many features have geographic limitations
