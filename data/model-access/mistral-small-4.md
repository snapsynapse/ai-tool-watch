## Summary

Mistral Small 4 is a 119B Mixture-of-Experts model (128 experts, 4 active per token, ~6–6.5B active parameters) that unifies instruct, reasoning, multimodal, and agentic coding into a single open model. Apache 2.0 license. 256k context window with native vision and a configurable `reasoning_effort` parameter. Available via Mistral API and self-hosted, but requires datacenter-class GPUs (4× H100 minimum).

## Deployment Modes

- self-hosted
- cloud-api (Mistral API / AI Studio)
- cloud-api (NVIDIA NIM)

## Common Runtimes

- vLLM
- SGLang
- llama.cpp
- NVIDIA NIM
- Mistral API

## Constraints

- datacenter-class hardware required: minimum 4× H100 or 2× H200 or 1× DGX B200
- NOT practical for consumer GPUs despite being open-weight
- 119B total parameters but only ~6–6.5B active per token (MoE); the announcement says 6B, the docs page and model card say 6.5B
- FP8/NVFP4 support recommended for optimal performance
